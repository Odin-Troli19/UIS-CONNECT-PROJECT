Normalization Steps - UIS-Connect

We applied normalization up to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data consistency, eliminate
redundancy, and improve query efficiency in the UIS-Connect project.


1. First Normal Form (1NF):
 - All tables have atomic (indivisible) values.
 - There are no repeating groups or arrays in any column.
 - Each record is unique and has a primary key.


2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
 - All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.
 - Since we are not using composite primary keys, each non-key column is directly related to the
unique primary key of the table.
 - For example, in the Posts table, 'content' and 'timestamp' depend entirely on 'id' and not partially
on another field.


3. Third Normal Form (3NF):
 - No transitive dependencies exist (i.e., non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key
attributes).
 - In the Users table, we do not store derived or duplicate information.
 - Each field depends only on the primary key.


Table Overview:
Users (id, username, major, interests)
Posts (id, user_id, content, timestamp)
Comments (id, post_id, user_id, content, timestamp)
Likes (id, post_id, user_id)
Friendships (id, user_id_1, user_id_2)


Conclusion:
All five tables follow 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF rules. We ensured each table is focused on a single topic
with proper foreign keys to handle relationships between data.
